      "body": "This Message Is From an Untrusted Sender\r\nYou have not previously corresponded with this sender.\r\nHello Scott & Rich,\r\nBelow are some notes about the Terminology section for 2026bis\r\n\r\n1.1. Terminology\r\n \r\nContribution:\r\nDoes this include an IETF github repo? Does this include edits made to documents produced on github but not in an IETF repo? If you re-read those two questions, does it sound to you as if the IETF is an organization? Or does it sound to you that any Github repo run by a Contributor is considered an IETF run repo.  //very important//\r\n \r\nIETF & IETF Area:\r\n\"In the context of this document, the IETF includes all individuals who participate in meetings, working groups, mailing lists, functions, and other activities that are organized or initiated by ISOC, the IESG, or the IAB under the general designation of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), but solely to the extent of such participation.\"\r\n\r\nBased on the above definition, I don't think the IETF can have an IETF chair. I think there can only be an IETF Area's chair.\r\n \r\n\r\nIETF Documents:\r\nThe word \"published\" needs a definition in the terminology section. Example, even if the submission of an Internet Draft is a Contribution does that mean it is also published? And does that mean all Contributions are \"published\"? Are IANA registrations considered \"published\" when IANA recieves them or only when IANA posts them to a mailing list or registry webpage?\r\nThe word \"obsoletes/obsoleted\" needs a definition in the terminology section. (found twelve times in your 2026bis draft and it means different things to different people *especially to the IESG/IAB in an appeal)\r\n \r\n \r\n\"Specification\" needs a definition or at least a pointer in the terminology section. \"specification\" appears 151 times in your draft. How many kinds of specifications do you have, In section 6.1 they're called Internet specifications. What kind of specification is needed for the 600+ types of registrations that are currently under the catagory of 'specification required'? If these \"specification required' registrations are _NOT_ part of the IETF standards process then the terms in section 5 do not apply to them.\r\n \r\nFor some registrations you accept specifications from an \"approved list of organizations\" Do those have a different name? Why would those be any better than others written elswhere? A recent denial example is on Nottingham's _well-known mailing list. Having a pre-approved list of acceptable registrants could come back to bite you pretty hard.",

The actual issue text talks about RFC 2026 referring to the Internet Standards (see https://github.com/ietf-wg-procon/2026bis/issues/44), specifically this text in S3.1 of RFC 2026:\n\n\"A TS may be completely self-\n   contained, or it may incorporate material from other specifications\n   by reference to other documents (which might or might not be Internet\n   Standards).\"\n\nBut you also raised another question about what levels of specifications may refer to other levels. Did I understand this correctly? Would it be reasonable to open a new issue for the second issue?\n\nWhen it comes to the former issue, I think it is somewhat loose language in the original RFC that causes a misunderstanding. For context RFC 2026 had three separate concepts: 1/ Internet Standard Specifications (S3), Internet Standards Track (S4), and Internet Standard (S4.1.3). I suspect the S3.1 text tried to refer to the first concept but because of a missing last word we interpret it as a reference to the third concept. But I could be wrong. Thoughts?\n\nThe meeting suggested that we could classify this issue as an editorial one. That\u2019s certainly the case if my interpretation from above is right. \n\nCould you suggest a resolution, and do other people have comments?",
